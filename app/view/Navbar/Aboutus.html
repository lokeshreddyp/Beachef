   <p>Hello,</p>
<p align = "justify"> <b>BeAChef’s</b> motive is to give people the power to share their recipe all over the world. BeAChef is an easy and fun way to share the recipe with others and makes everyone of its users show their expertise in culinary arts. Good food is about having fun in the kitchen. Preparing good food should not become difficult, it’s all about sharing and exploring the recipes. We believe BeAChef app makes it easy in exploring the recipes and sharing their recipes with others. People can login with the social networking apps like Facebook and Google and can create their own recipe to share it with others. Recipe details include image of the recipe, number of servings, estimated time and the description to create the recipe. People can be able to make the recipe as their favorite by liking the recipe of others and share it with friends in other social networking apps.
